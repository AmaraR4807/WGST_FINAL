            <p>
                I am Amara Ramm. I grew up in cohoes NY and am a 1st year student at Rochester Institute of technology. I am majoring in Software Engineering with a minor in Spanish Studies.  I am a Transgender Women and Asexual Lesbian, I've been taking Hormone Replacement Therapy for over a year. LGBTQ+ topics have always been a big interest of mine, as it affects me directly. I think there is a lot we can learn from queer history that has shaped this community. I believe it is important for everyone to know how we got here, that way we make sure none of us are forgotten.
