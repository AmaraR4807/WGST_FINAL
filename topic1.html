            <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
            <p>
            Intersectionality examines how a person’s identities, such as their race, gender, ethnicity, and sexuality, affect their access to opportunities and privileges. Despite the term intersectionality was originally coined in 1989 by Kimberle Crenshaw, some could argue that intersectionality is all around us, and still continues to this day.
            <br><br>
            Intersectionality is one of the several queer theories. The theory addressed how parts of one’s identity, such as race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and even economic status affect how a person is treated. As a concept, intersectional theory contrasts monism, which is the idea that each factor of an individual (e.g., race and gender) can be adequately understood or investigated separately from one another, as a single dimension. (Guy-Evans pg 2)  Kimberle Crenshaw and other queer theorists noticed how someone attributed to more than one minority would face discrimination that was greater than the sum of its parts. The example Kimberle Crenshaw used for this theory is the discrimination of black women as part of her work in critical race theory. (Amory, 6). She found that black women were still facing discrimination in places that hired black men and white women. Meaning that the combination of being a person of color and a woman had an effect of combined prejudices, leading to discrimination that was easily overlooked. (Meem 189) Critics of the theory say Intersectionality oversimplifies how power and discrimination work. However, it is hard to deny the fact that new forms of discrimination and prejudice emerge when someone is attributed to more than one minority. A growing modern example being transmisogyny to transgender women.
