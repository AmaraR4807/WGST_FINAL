            <h2>Important Places and Events</h2>
            <h3>Stonewall Riots</h3>
            <p>
                Stonewall Inn was a mafia-run bar that would allow queer and trans people in, mostly because there was no bars for gay people, and the mafia was already committing crimes, this bar not having a proper liquor license, so it didn't really hurt them to allow gay people. They could charge extra for drinks that were poor quality and severely watered down knowing gay people would pay for it. They also would blackmail richer patrons, claiming that they would out them. (1969 Stonewall Riots 7-9) So in the end it only happened because it benefited the Mafia. But it gave queer people a place to gather.

                However, it was also a target of brutal police raids. And on June 28, 1969, one of these raids was performed on the Inn. Clients were sexually harassed as they were stripped for genitile checks. 13 people were arrested, and a crowd began to gather outside the Inn. The riots unfolded after an officer hit a lesbian over the head as he forced her into the police van. The crowd started rioting, and the event became a big moment of activism towards Queer Liberation

            <h3>The AIDS Epedemic</h3>
            <p>
                HIV, otherwise known as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is a virus that attacks the immune system, specifically CD4 cells (or T cells). They weaken the body’s immune response. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids of any kind. Historically, HIV has most often been spread through unprotected sex, the sharing of needles for drug use, and through birth. When HIV reaches it's stage where the body can no longer fight infections and diseases, they are diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. AIDS has no cure, but there are treatments to prevent the spread of it and to extend one's lifetime to about as long as someone without the virus.
                <br><br>
                The first HIV pandemic occurred in Africa in the 1920s, likely due to hunters eating or getting chimp blood into their systems. It is believed that Chimpanzees carried a strain of the virus initially. But HIV didn't make its way to the US until the 1970s. (History of AIDS, 4) Men were primarily the victims of AIDS, and many of the first cases were amongst gay men. So it was believed that AIDS was the “Gay Virus" and it caused a lot of stigma against the community. The community turned on itself, some gay men accusing others of spreading AIDS by having multiple sexual partners. Meanwhile the epidemic had another impact. With Gay people not being able to legally marry, they could not see their partners who were dying in the hospital. This sparked the desire for Gay Marriage, in order to have the rights of a married couple.

            <h3>Legalization of Gay Marraige</h3>
            <p>
                Same sex marriage wasn’t initally a cause that queer people fought for. Many believed that it pushed homosexuality into a heteronormative culture. Some people, such as Paula Ettelbrick, believed that gay marriage would not solve the oppression queer people face, and would force them to be more behind the curtains. But the Aids Epidemic changed that because people's partners were dying in hospitals and they didn't have a right to see them. So this began the long battle for Gay Marriage.

                DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996. DOMA defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, preventing federal recognition of same-sex marriages. (Same-Sex Marriage and the Law, 2) However, in 1999 the Vermont Supreme Court declared that same-sex couples were entitled under the state constitution to the same legal rights as married heterosexual couples; creating “civil unions,” which had all the rights and responsibilities of marriage but not the name. In 2003, California later did the same with “domestic partnerships,” and the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the state constitution. 
                <br><br>
                Many other states followed suit later on. In 2013, the SCOTUS case United States v. Windsor struck down a key provision of DOMA, ruling that it violated the Fifth Amendment by denying federal benefits to legally married same-sex couples. In January 2015 the Supreme Court agreed to review a November 2014 decision of the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit. In June (Ironic because it’s during pride month), in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court reversed both of the Sixth Circuit’s holdings in a 5-4 concensus, thereby legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states. (Same-Sex Marriage and the Law, 10)
