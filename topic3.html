            <h2>Have Queer People Always Existed?</h2>
            <p>
                This is an interesting question when it comes to LGBTQ+ studies. The issue about this question is that it is vague. What is queer? What was queer then? Is homosexuality and being gay different things? The short answer to this big question is that it is complicated. So in order to answer this question properly, we need to define some things.
                <br><br>
                For this question, Homosexuality and being gay/queer are different things. Homesexuality refers to the more scientific sense of a same-sex sexual encounter, where being gay/queer has actual romantic aspects that go against gender norms. With this definition, it can be easily said that Homosexuality has always existed. Men on men relations were common in the Greek and Roman empire, but they weren't gay. Looking at the Roman empire, Homosexuality appeared in the form of power dynamics. Rome was very patriarchal and had a strict hierarchy. Older men were at the top, followed by younger men, then male slaves and indentured servants, then women. Men could indulge in sexual encounters with anyone who was below them in a form of asserting dominance. As long as the act contributed to these gender norms, it was okay, and therefore not gay. (Jasiński 2) However, overindulgence, or a higher status man being put in a passive or receiving situation in a relationship (regardless of with a man or woman) was considered wrong, and a man could be ridiculed or punished for it. This would be gay as it goes against societal norms.
                <br><br>
                More often than not, Gay people in history seem to be the minority as in most cultures, Heterosexuality was normalized under certain circumstances. It is usually a rare circumstance for someone to actually be gay. This is where we come to another example, the well-known Sappho of Lesbos. Right away she is in a rare situation being an aristocratic woman who was well educated. She was criticized often for being a “masculine woman” and even got exiled to Sicily twice for her political views (Mark 5). Her poems seemed to address an extreme depth of feeling and intimacy towards women, but it is not confirmed if she actually liked women or not. She commonly criticised the politics of the world, and her expression for women could have just simply been to ridicule patriarchy. It's hard to know for sure, and this is the case with many people historians think are queer throughout history.
                <br><br>
                The other issue about queer and gay is that they are modern terms that apply to modern society. It doesn't work to apply them to anything pre-Victorian era. It wasn't until the Victorian era with Queen Victoria of Britain, that society gained modern gender roles. Queen Victoria ruled from  June 20, 1837, until her death on January 22, 1901, totaling 63 years and 216 days. During this time period the British empire had colonies all over the world, so they were very influential. Queen Victoria implemented a lot of policies that redefined gender. Heels and tights, which had been outfits specifically for wealthy men, had become feminine things. The color pink, which also signified manly status, also became a color for women. She also banned homosexual acts between men, surprisingly not between women. Homosexuality was deemed an act of Sodomy, which at this point in time was punished by hard labor and imprisonment. (Historic Denver, 5) And these laws stuck and were implemented everywhere, even being adopted by the United states
                <br><br>
                However, this wasn’t necessarily completely bad. Having such big upfront and center laws like this makes people who weren't aware of homosexuality aware of it. In some instances it could have even encouraged people to be homosexual. All of a sudden homosexuality, and later transgenderness became interesting. People wanted to know more about it, leading to the development of the Berlin Institute of Sexology where the first transgender operations were successfully performed. So while queer people may or may not have always existed, they have a strong history.
