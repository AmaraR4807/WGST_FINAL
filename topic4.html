            <h2>What is LGBTQ?</h2>
            <p>
                LGBTQ is an acronym for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Queer. Other iterations of the acronym include an I for intersex, an A for asexual, aromantic, and agender. Occasionally there will be a 2S at the front to represent 2 spirit individuals which is a gender identity that has strong ties into native american culture. And then most times there is a ‘+’ to simply include all other identities.
                <br><br>
                LGB were the original 3 in the acronym, representing the different common sexualities. Gay is a generally broad term that refers to homosexuality in a broad sense, but often gets used specifically for homosexual men. Lesbian is specifically non-men liking non-men, which can include trans women, and non-binary individuals. Bisexuality refers to liking two different genders, it doesn't exclusively have to be men and women. (ex. Non-Binary and Women). These aren't the only sexualities, however. Some interesting history, the acronym used to be GLBT. This was rooted in some misogyny, and lesbian groups had pushed for the L to be moved to the front. This got changed to LGBT to honor lesbians and their advocacy and support towards gay men in the AIDS epidemic. Lesbians were generally unaffected from the AIDS epidemic, while gay men suffered a lot, but this didn't stop lesbians from pushing advocacy and activism. (The Observer, 3)
                <br><br>
                The T represents trans people, a very large umbrella term to represent people whose gender identity does not align with their gender assigned at birth. The t was added to the LGB in the 1990s. Trans people have been a pivotal part of LGB and GLB activism, but were constantly not included. It wasn’t until pushbacks from the community that the T was added. A pride march in London, 1998 proudly carried a banner that spelled each letter of the acronym, eventually cementing their place in the community. (Clarke, 9) There is no correct way to be trans, it's a unique journey for everyone. Some people go on HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy), some people surgically transition, and some people don't. Some people change their name, while others keep their name. 
                <br><br>
                Queer, Intersex, and Asexuality are all terms that later got added to the acronym. Queer is a slur that got reclaimed by the LGBTQ community. It used to mean weird or strange, but now is a label many queer people use. Intersex is unique because it is an identity along with being inherently biological. Intersex refers to any biological variation from the typical binary of male and female. This can appear chromosomally, hormonally, and physically in the development of reproductive organs. Some might not even know they are Intersex until later in life. Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction. This is also an umbrella term, as there are many different variations of asexuality. The asexual community often faces a lot of erasure, and some argue that asexuality isn’t a real sexuality, or is caused by factors like trauma or just simply a phase. However, Asexuality is arguably important, because critics say the LGBTQ community is all about sex. So by including Asexuality, a repulsion or aversion to sex, it proves that the LGBTQ community is not inherently sexual.
                <br><br>
                There are so many more gender identities and sexualities, all unique in their own ways. There should be no one sexuality or gender identity that is superior to the other. By infighting and policing identities, the LGBTQ community, which is already a minority, is broken up furthermore. So it is essential for people to understand that the LGBTQ community is a collection of smaller voices that come together like a choir with a much louder and more powerful voice.
