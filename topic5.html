            <h2>Media Representation and Suppression</h2>
            <p>
                Media is such a complex topic in general, but especially when put into the context of LGBTQ+ studies. Media as a general concept refers to all mediums of physical and digital media. This looks like newspapers and magazines, books, movies and films, music, radio stations, news outlets, and social media. Throughout history, LGBTQ activists have used media as a platform for liberation, and Anti-LGBTQ individuals have used media as a tool of oppression.

                The very first platforms of LGBTQ representation was books and queer magazines. A very popular magazine writer is Eydthe Eyde, who used the pen name Lisa Ben, which was an anagram for Lesbian. She wrote the first Lesbian magazines and helped distribute them. She published nine issues of “Vice Versa” between June 1947 and February 1948.

                Eventually the Film industry started to grow big, especially with Hollywood. Like the early days of the internet, there were no rules or limitations to what could be in a film. Several films featured queer representation before William H. Hays took on the position of Chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributers of America, in 1952. (Yarger 3) The Catholic Church wrote a set of principles for Hays to enforce in order to clean Hollywood like he claimed he would. This later became the Hays code. These codes presented strict christian guidelines that are used to censor anything lewd or violent. This made it so queer representation, if involved would have to be some evil character or they would have to die in a terrible and tragic way to discourage others to be gay. (Doherty 362-363). And this had an effect on LGBTQ+ representation, because they were often humiliated or mocked in these films, or they were presented as evil villains or predators. And since the average citizen would watch these, they would believe that that is what all gay people are. With the modern developed rating system (G, M, PG, PG-13, M, R, NC-17) that this stigma got better. Films depicting queer characters were put at a higher rating. It wasn't until Activism from organizations like The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), whose efforts led to Homosexuality in media being less obscene.

                With the development of social media, we enter an era of fast, mainstream media. There was more queer representation in the early 2000s, with queer media being able to be at the forefront and easy to access in people’s households. At this point, many people have a computer or some device to access the internet, and everyone has a household TV. Media in people’s faces makes people more aware of the issues. Queer content creators gain a voice, and representative media can get pushed to larger audiences. The early 2000s was an influx of queer representation. One of the biggest developments was Cartoon Network’s, Steven Universe by Rabecca Sugar presenting the first mainstream Gay Wedding scene between two main characters.
